# CoEpi MVP

This repo is a bare-bones MVP for CoEpi. 

## Testing

### Get the client app

For Android, simply install the [client app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) 

For iOS, you'll need a special build of the client, and you'll need to be logged in with the coepi expo account. contact Ryan Bennett on Slack for the password and a link to install the special build of the client app.

Once you have the Expo App, you should be able to open the [latest version](https://expo.io/@coepi/coepi-mvp) on your phone.

## Development

Ensure that you have the latest versions of NodeJS and Yarn installed.

```bash
$ yarn global add expo-cli
$ git clone git@github.com:Co-Epi/mvp
$ cd mvp
$ yarn
$ expo start
```

The `expo start` command will start a daemon to watch files for changes and rebuild, and it will launch your default webbrowser with a dashboard containing, among other things, options to open the app in iOS/Android simulators or on a physical device via scanned QR code. 

**Note:** When using a physical device, you'll need the expo client app installed (see *testing* above). Also; be sure that you're dev machine and phone are both on the same LAN (if this is not possible, expo also offers a tunneling option, but LAN is the default and is faster).

## Design
### Libraries
